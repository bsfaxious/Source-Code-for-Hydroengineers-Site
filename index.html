<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p style="padding: 40px">In the 21st century where we are always striving to find new forms of sustainable energy, hydro-electric power, power obtained from falling water is becoming more and more widely used. Mechanical engineers design, develop, and test the machines involved in operating turbines and wind farms. They also work on the machinery and manufacturing processes used to make them. These machines work together to construct efficient energy harvesting technologies that make clean, renewable energy a reality. With large amounts of jobs and opportunities appearing in this branch of work, this site is going to inform you on the ins and outs of a career in hydropower engineering.
</p>

<h2 id="turbine">Turbines</h2>

<p style="padding: 40px">Above, you are able to see a basic diagram of a simple water turbine system. It works by obtaining energy from the movement of a river. Dam operators, like the one you see in the middle of the diagram control water flow and amount of electricity obtained, while creating reservoirs for drinking water and sanctuaries/recreation. Flowing water turns the turbine and the generator, which is attached to this turbine, will make the electricity, which is then used for everyday purposes after a few extra procedures. But have you ever wondered, how is the water converted to power through just a simple spinning turbine? Well, that is due to the kinetic energy in the water flow which gets converted through the turbine as mentioned earlier.</p>

<h2 id="relate">Windmills</h2>


<p style="padding: 40px">Recently (and interestingly), windmills have been getting incorporated into hydropower generation. It works like this: the hydroplant is used as a battery for the windmills. When energy is needed, water flows down to generate it, and when the supply gets high the energy will be pumped into the windmill reservoirs. When the price is high for energy, it can use water. When the price is low, it can access the reservoirs. The above diagram indicates this pretty clearly and shows how the process would work. This was first built in Germany in 2018 and provided a very rapid increase in output compared to the traditional watermill design.</p>

<h2 id="windmill">Qualifications</h2>
<p style="padding: 40px">Now you know what the job does, so we would like to introduce some of the qualifications you would require, and ones you would benefit from by posessing. A required early step is to pursue a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. Getting work experience through internships and co-op is beneficial. Then, getting an entry level job and earning a Professional Engineer designation will give you access to more of the higher-end designer jobs in this line of work. The typical Canadian Hydroengineer's wage per year is around 106k, however at an early level you can come from as low as $80k and finish at a high $130k.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits of Hydroenergy</h2>
<p style="padding: 40px">Here are some benefits of hydroenergy. It's green, as it's renewable and sustainable. It's reliable, domestic in the case of Canada and it's flexible in form of usage, as demonstrated in it's synergy with windmills. There are low levels of pollution and cost per energy generated, and it opens up new job opportunities for engineers.  It can help structurally develop areas and remote regions. And finally, it can be used for flood control, low-carbon transportation, recreation (as lakes nearby are stabilized with the power generation dam), and electricity production, it's primary use.</p>

<h2 id="costs">Costs</h2>
<p style="padding: 40px">Here are some forseeable costs of hydroenergy generation. It hurts nearby environments and destroys some of them in the process of construction. Habitats are destroyed and water quality goes down. There is a lot of dependence on that one system due to the cost association if it's built in an area, and construction itself is already costly. Droughts can hurt hydroenergy generation and there is always risk of accidents and border conflicts. Finally, landowners will stand against the development/enlargement of windmill/turbine systems nearby their land.</p>

<h2 id="req">Community Impact</h2>
<p style="padding: 40px">For countries with lack of energy for consistent usage, hydroenergy is very beneficial toward their communities. Massachussets, a US state with a firm dedication toward moving toward clean and sustainable energy sources invested $1.6B into it's hydropower transmission line in 2018, initially met with disagreement because of the large budgetting however was eventually completed. Going 192 miles long, this sought to meet many of the state's carbon emission reduction goals for the year as well as satisfy environmentalists, which it successfully did. Another positive community it can offer is to is wildlife, as reduced carbon emissions mean safer habitats in the area.</p>

<h2 id="ex.">Example: Niagara's Turbine System</h2>
<p style="padding: 40px">Niagara Falls' hydropower generation system involving the Falls have existed for a long time now, about 100 years. It follows the pattern of a dam near the bottom of the falls, where there is a large stone dam, which many people who have been to Niagara may have seen. Power is generated through the turbine and sent off for usage.</p>

<h2 id="end">Conclusion</h2>
<p style="padding: 40px">In conclusion, the future of hydroenergy appears bright and the engineering in that line of work takes a lot of effort to be maintained and presented in the way it's being done in society right now. Look forward the the future innovations this line of work has to offer.</p>
